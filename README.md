# Mateybyrd.Net
Contains the source code of my website http://www.mateybyrd.net

The code is split between two major branches, the master branch is the branch used on http://www.mateybyrd.net, the dev branch is used on http://dev.mateybyrd.net.

The website is build using a nodejs as server backend, this is my first time using nodejs as backend. I am using nodejs, so javascript, together with jade (html formatting) and express (web server handling). I run the server on my own VPS where I use the forever package to run the server in the background.
